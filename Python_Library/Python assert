Python assert断言函数

self.assertEqual

assertEqual(first, second, msg=None)
Test that first and second are equal. If the values do not compare equal, the test will fail.

In addition, if first and second are the exact same type and one of list, tuple, dict, set, frozenset
or str or any type that a subclass registers with addTypeEqualityFunc() the type-specific equality function 
will be called in order to generate a more useful default error message (see also the list of type-specific methods).
