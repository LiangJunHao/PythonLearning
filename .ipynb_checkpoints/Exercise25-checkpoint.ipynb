    "This exercise is likely a tool to handle the word and sentence. At the begining, we use **split** to divide the sentence to words. Then we define a function sort_words to sort the word.(**sorted(words)**) Then the *print_first_word* and *print_last_word* function implemented by using the stack(pop). The **sort_sentence** is a combination of the function *break_word* and *sort_words*. And the next two function are using the same way to achieve their functions."
